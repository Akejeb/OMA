The
[`SummarizedExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html)
(`SE`) is a widely used class for analyzing data obtained by common sequencing
techniques. `SE` is common structure for several Bioconductor packages that are
used for analyzing RNAseq, ChIp-Seq data. `SE` class is also used in R packages
for analyzing microarrays, flow cytometry, proteomics, single-cell sequencing
data and many more. The single-cell analysis is facilitated by
[SingelCellExperiment
class](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SingleCellExperiment/inst/doc/intro.html)
(`SCE`), which allows the user to store results of dimensionality reduction and
alternative experiments. Alternative experiments (`altExps`) can be differently
processed data within the analysis workflows.

Recently,
[`TreeSummarizedExperiment`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TreeSummarizedExperiment.html)
(`TSE`)
was developed to extend the `SE` and `SCE` class for incorporating hierarchical
information (including phylogenetic tree) and reference sequences.

The `mia` package implements tools using these classes for analysis of
microbiome sequencing data.

## Background

The widely used `phyloseq` package and class were around before the [`SummarizedExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html)  
and the derived 
[`TreeSummarizedExperiment`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TreeSummarizedExperiment.html) 
class. Many methods for taxonomic profiling data are readily available for the  `phyloseq` class structure. 

In order to facilitate the transition, we provide here a short description how `phyloseq` and `*Experiment` classes relate to 
each other.

`assays`     : This slot is similar to `otu_table` in `phyloseq`. In a `SummarizedExperiment`
               object multiple assays, raw counts, transformed counts can be stored. See also 
               [`MultiAssayExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html) for storing data from multiple `experiments` such as RNASeq, Proteomics, etc.       
`rowData`    : This slot is similar to `tax_table` in `phyloseq` to store taxonomic information.     
`colData`    : This slot is similar to `sample_data` in `phyloseq` to store information related to samples.    
`rowTree`    : This slot is similar to `phy_tree` in `phyloseq` to store phylogenetic tree.     

In this book, you will come across terms like `FeatureIDs` and `SampleIDs`.   
`FeatureIDs` : These are basically OTU/ASV ids which are row names in `assays` and `rowData`.    
`SampleIDs`  : As the name suggests, these are sample ids which are column names in `assays` and row names in `colData`.  

`FeatureIDs` and `SampleIDs` are used but the technical terms `rownames` and 
`colnames` are encouraged to be used, since they relate to actual objects we 
work with.

## Loading experimental microbiome data


### Importing data from external files

Microbiome (taxonomic) profiling data is commonly distributed in
various file formats. You can import such external data files as a
(Tree)SummarizedExperiment object but the details depend on the file
format. Here, we provide examples for common formats.

**CSV data tables** can be imported with the standard R functions,
  then converted to the desired format. For detailed examples, you can
  check the [Bioconductor course
  material](https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2019/BSS2019/04_Practical_CoreApproachesInBioconductor.html)
  by Martin Morgan. The following example reads abundance tables,
  taxonomic mapping tables, and sample metadata, assuming that the
  input data files are properly prepared with appropriate row and
  column names.

```{r importingcsv, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
counts  <- read.csv(count_file)   # Abundance table (e.g. ASV data; to assay data)
tax     <- read.csv(tax_file)     # Taxonomy table (to rowData)
samples <- read.csv(sample_file)  # Sample data (to colData)
se <- SummarizedExperiment(assays = list(counts = counts),
                           colData = samples,
                           rowData = tax)
```

Specific import functions are provided for:

-   Biom files (see `help(mia::loadFromBiom)`)
-   QIIME2 files (see `help(mia::loadFromQIIME2)`)
-   Mothur files (see `help(mia::loadFromMothur)`)

#### Example for importing Biom files

This example shows how Biom files are imported into a TreeSummarizedExperiment object. 

The data is from following publication: 
Tengeler AC _et al._ (2020) [**Gut microbiota from persons with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affects the brain in
mice**](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-020-00816-x). 

The data set consists of 3 files:

-   biom file: abundance table and taxonomy information
-   csv file: sample metadata
-   tree file: phylogenetic tree

Store the data in your desired local directory (for instance, _data/_ under the
working directory), and define source file paths

```{r}
biom_file_path <- "data/Aggregated_humanization2.biom"
sample_meta_file_path <- "data/Mapping_file_ADHD_aggregated.csv"
tree_file_path <- "data/Data_humanization_phylo_aggregation.tre"
```  

Now we can load the biom data into a SummarizedExperiment (SE) object.

```{r}
library(mia)

# Imports the data
se <- loadFromBiom(biom_file_path)

# Check
se
```  

The `assays` slot includes a list of abundance tables. The imported abundance table is named as "counts".
Let us inspect only the first cols and rows.

```{r}
assays(se)$counts[1:3, 1:3]
```

The `rowdata` includes taxonomic information from the biom file. The `head()` command
shows just the beginning of the data table for an overview.

`knitr::kable()` is for printing the information more nicely.

```{r}
head(rowData(se))
```

These taxonomic rank names (column names) are not real rank names. Letâ€™s replace them with real rank names.

In addition to that, the taxa names include, e.g., '"k__' before the name, so let's
make them cleaner by removing them. 

```{r}
names(rowData(se)) <- c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", 
                        "Family", "Genus")

# Goes through the whole DataFrame. Removes '.*[kpcofg]__' from strings, where [kpcofg] 
# is any character from listed ones, and .* any character.
rowdata_modified <- BiocParallel::bplapply(rowData(se), 
                                           FUN = stringr::str_remove, 
                                           pattern = '.*[kpcofg]__')

# Genus level has additional '\"', so let's delete that also
rowdata_modified <- BiocParallel::bplapply(rowdata_modified, 
                                           FUN = stringr::str_remove, 
                                           pattern = '\"')

# rowdata_modified is a list, so it is converted back to DataFrame format. 
rowdata_modified <- DataFrame(rowdata_modified)

# And then assigned back to the SE object
rowData(se) <- rowdata_modified

# Now we have a nicer table
head(rowData(se))
```

We notice that the imported biom file did not contain the sample meta data
yet, so it includes an empty data frame.

```{r}
head(colData(se))
```

Let us add a sample metadata file.

```{r}
# We use this to check what type of data it is
# read.table(sample_meta_file_path)

# It seems like a comma separated file and it does not include headers
# Let us read it and then convert from data.frame to DataFrame
# (required for our purposes)
sample_meta <- DataFrame(read.table(sample_meta_file_path, sep = ",", header = FALSE))

# Add sample names to rownames
rownames(sample_meta) <- sample_meta[,1]

# Delete column that included sample names
sample_meta[,1] <- NULL

# We can add headers
colnames(sample_meta) <- c("patient_status", "cohort", "patient_status_vs_cohort", "sample_name")

# Then it can be added to colData
colData(se) <- sample_meta
```

Now `colData` includes the sample metadata.

```{r}
head(colData(se))
```

Now, let's add a phylogenetic tree.

The current data object, se, is a SummarizedExperiment object. This
does not include a slot for adding a phylogenetic tree. In order to do
this, we can convert the SE object to an extended TreeSummarizedExperiment
object which includes also a `rowTree` slot.

```{r}
tse <- as(se, "TreeSummarizedExperiment")

# tse includes same data as se
tse
```

Next, let us read the tree data file and add it to the R data object (tse).

```{r}
# Reads the tree file
tree <- ape::read.tree(tree_file_path)

# Add tree to rowTree
rowTree(tse) <- tree

# Check
tse
```

Now `rowTree` includes a phylogenetic tree:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(rowTree(tse))
```

### Conversions between data formats in R

If the data has already been imported in R in another format, it
can be readily converted into `TreeSummarizedExperiment`, as shown in our next
example. Note that similar conversion functions to
`TreeSummarizedExperiment` are available for multiple data formats via
the `mia` package (see makeTreeSummarizedExperimentFrom* for phyloseq,
Biom, and DADA2).

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mia)

# phyloseq example data
data(GlobalPatterns, package="phyloseq") 
GlobalPatterns_phyloseq <- GlobalPatterns
GlobalPatterns_phyloseq
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
# convert phyloseq to TSE
GlobalPatterns_TSE <- makeTreeSummarizedExperimentFromPhyloseq(GlobalPatterns_phyloseq) 
GlobalPatterns_TSE
```

We can also convert `TreeSummarizedExperiment` objects into `phyloseq`
with respect to the shared components that are supported by both
formats (i.e. taxonomic abundance table, sample metadata, taxonomic
table, phylogenetic tree, sequence information). This is useful for
instance when additional methods are available for `phyloseq`.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# convert TSE to phyloseq
GlobalPatterns_phyloseq2 <- makePhyloseqFromTreeSummarizedExperiment(GlobalPatterns_TSE) 
GlobalPatterns_phyloseq2
```

## Metadata

## Microbiome and tree data specific aspects

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mia)
data("GlobalPatterns", package = "mia")
se <- GlobalPatterns 
se
```

### Assays  

The `assays` slot contains the experimental data as count matrices. Multiple 
matrices can be stored the result of `assays` is actually a list of matrices.

```{r}
assays(se)
```

Individual assays can be accessed via `assay`

```{r}
assay(se, "counts")[1:5,1:7]
```

To illustrate the use of multiple assays, the relative abundance data can be 
calcualted and stored along the original count data using `relAbundanceCounts`.

```{r}
se <- relAbundanceCounts(se)
assays(se)
```

Now there are two assays available in the `se` object, `counts` and 
`relabundance`.

```{r}
assay(se, "relabundance")[1:5,1:7]
```

### colData

`colData` contains data on the samples.

```{r coldata}
colData(se)
```

### rowData

`rowData` contains data on the features of the analyzed samples. Of particular
interest for the microbiome field this is used to store taxonomic information.

```{r rowdata}
rowData(se)
```

### rowTree  

Phylogenetic trees also play an important role for the microbiome field. The 
`TreeSummarizedExperiment` class is able to keep track of feature and node
relations via two functions, `rowTree` and `rowLinks`.

A tree can be accessed via `rowTree` as `phylo` object.       
```{r rowtree}
rowTree(se)
```

The links to the individual features are available through `rowLinks`.

```{r rowlinks}
rowLinks(se)
```

Please note that there can be a 1:1 relationship between tree nodes and 
features, but this is not a must have. This means there can be features, which
are not linked to nodes, and nodes, which are not linked to features. To change
the links in an existing object, the `changeTree` function is available.

## Data manipulation

Sometimes custom solutions are needed for analyzing the data. `mia` contains a 
few functions to help in these situations.

### Tidy data

For several custom analysis and visualization packages, such as those from the 
`tidyverse`, the `SE` data can be converted to long data.frame format with 
`meltAssay`.    

```{r}
library(mia)
molten_se <- meltAssay(se,
                       add_row_data = TRUE,
                       add_col_data = TRUE,
                       abund_values = "relabundance")
molten_se
```

### Subsetting

**Subsetting** data helps to draw the focus of analysis on particular sets of samples and / or features. When dealing with large data sets, the subset of interest can be extracted and investigated separately. This might improve performance and reduce the computational load.

Load:

* mia
* dplyr
* knitr
* data `GlobalPatterns`

```{r include = FALSE}
# load libraries and data
library(mia)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
```

Let us store `GlobalPatterns` into `se` and check its original number of features (rows) and samples (columns). **Note**: when subsetting by sample, expect the number of columns to decrease; when subsetting by feature, expect the number of rows to decrease.

```{r}
# store data into se and check dimensions
data("GlobalPatterns", package="mia")
se <- GlobalPatterns
# show dimensions
dim(se) ## [1] nÂ°features    nÂ°samples
```

#### Subset by sample (column-wise)

For the sake of demonstration, here we will extract a subset containing only the samples of human origin (feces, skin or tongue), stored as `SampleType` within `colData(se)` and also in `se`.

First, we would like to see all the possible values that `SampleType` can take on and how frequent those are: 

```{r}
# inspect possible values for SampleType
unique(se$SampleType)
```
```{r eval = FALSE}
# show recurrence for each value
se$SampleType %>% table()
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
# show recurrence for each value
se$SampleType %>% table() %>% kable() %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling("striped", latex_options="scale_down") %>% 
    kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

**Note**: after subsetting, expect the number of columns to equal the sum of the recurrences of the samples that you are interested in. For instance, `ncols = Feces + Skin + Tongue = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9`.

Next, we _logical index_ across the columns of `se` (make sure to leave the first index empty to select all rows) and filter for the samples of human origin. For this, we use the information on the samples from the meta data `colData(se)`.

```{r}
# subset by sample
se_subset_by_sample <- se[ , se$SampleType %in% c("Feces", "Skin", "Tongue")]
# show dimensions
dim(se_subset_by_sample)
```

As a sanity check, the new object `se_subset_by_sample` should have the original number of features (rows) and a number of samples (columns) equal to the sum of the samples of interest (in this case 9).

Several characteristics can be used to subset by sample:

* origin
* sampling time
* sequencing method
* DNA / RNA barcode
* cohort

#### Subset by feature (row-wise)

Similarly, here we will extract a subset containing only the features that belong to the Phyla "Actinobacteria" and "Chlamydiae", stored as `Phylum` within `rowData(se)`. However, subsetting by feature implies a few more obstacles, such as the presence of NA elements and the possible need for agglomeration.

As previously, we would first like to see all the possible values that `Phylum` can take on and how frequent those are:
  
```{r}
# inspect possible values for Phylum
unique(rowData(se)$Phylum)
```
```{r eval = FALSE}
# show recurrence for each value
rowData(se)$Phylum %>% table()
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
# show recurrence for each value
rowData(se)$Phylum %>% table() %>% kable() %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling("striped", latex_options="scale_down") %>% 
    kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

**Note**: after subsetting, expect the number of columns to equal the sum of the recurrences of the feature(s) that you are interested in. For instance, `nrows = Actinobacteria + Chlamydiae = 1631 + 21 = 1652`.

Depending on your research question, you might need to or need not agglomerate the data in the first place: if you want to find the abundance of each and every feature that belongs to Actinobacteria and Chlamydiae, agglomeration is not needed; if you want to find the total abundance of all the features that belong to Actinobacteria or Chlamydiae, agglomeration is recommended.

##### Not agglomerated data

Next, we _logical index_ across the rows of `se` (make sure to leave the second index empty to select all columns) and filter for the features that fall in either Actinobacteria or Chlamydiae. For this, we use the information on the samples from the meta data `rowData(se)`.

The  first term with the `%in%` operator are includes all  the features of interest, whereas the second term after the AND operator `&` filters out all the features that present a NA in place of Phylum.

```{r}
# subset by feature
se_subset_by_feature <- se[rowData(se)$Phylum %in% c("Actinobacteria", "Chlamydiae") & !is.na(rowData(se)$Phylum), ]
# show dimensions
dim(se_subset_by_feature)
```

As a sanity check, the new object `se_subset_by_feature` should have the original number of samples (columns) and a number of features (rows) equal to the sum of the features of interest (in this case 1652).

##### Agglomerated data

When total abundances of certain Phyla are of relevance, the data is initially agglomerated by Phylum. Then, similar steps as in the case of not agglomerated data are followed.

```{r}
# agglomerate by Phylum
se_phylum <- se %>% agglomerateByRank(rank = "Phylum")

# subset by feature and get rid of NAs
se_phylum_subset_by_feature <- se_phylum[rowData(se_phylum)$Phylum %in% c("Actinobacteria", "Chlamydiae") & !is.na(rowData(se_phylum)$Phylum), ]
# show dimensions
dim(se_phylum_subset_by_feature)
```

**Note**: as data was agglomerated, the number of rows equal the number of Phyla used to index (in this case, just 2)

Or alternatively:

```{r}
# store features of interest into phyla
phyla <- c("Phylum:Actinobacteria", "Phylum:Chlamydiae")
# subset by feature
se_phylum_subset_by_feature <- se_phylum[phyla, ]
# show dimensions
dim(se_subset_by_feature)
```

The code above returns the not agglomerated version of the data.

Fewer characteristics can be used to subset by feature:

* Taxonomic rank
* Meta-taxonomic group

For subsetting by Kingdom, agglomeration does not apply, whereas for the other ranks it can be applied if necessary.

#### Subset by sample and feature

Finally, we can subset data by sample and feature at once. The resulting subset contains all the samples of human origin and all the features of Phyla "Actinobacteria" or "Chlamydiae".

```{r}
# subset by sample and feature and get rid of NAs
se_subset_by_sample_feature <- se[rowData(se)$Phylum %in% c("Actinobacteria", "Chlamydiae") & !is.na(rowData(se)$Phylum), se$SampleType %in% c("Feces", "Skin", "Tongue")]
# show dimensions
dim(se_subset_by_sample_feature)
```

**Note**: the dimensions of `se_subset_by_sample_feature` agree with those of the previous subsets (9 columns filtered by sample and 1652 rows filtered by feature).

If a study was to consider and quantify the presence of Actinobacteria as well as Chlamydiae in different sites of the human body, `se_subset_by_sample_feature` might be a suitable subset to start with.
